# permit_predict
A linear regression pipeline for predicting the duration of time between permit application submission and permit provision.

This simple pipeline converts and combines JSON data regard permit applications and distribution into a .csv file. It then trains a linear
regressor to predict the amount of time it will take for an application to be accepted.
